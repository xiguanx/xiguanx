<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Xi</h1>
<h3 align="center">Full-stack Developer | Aspiring Database & Systems Engineer</h3>

<h3 align="left">ðŸ’¡ About Me</h3>

- I'm a software engineer with hands-on experience building scalable, high-performance applications across the full stack. 
- My recent work includes HIPAA-compliant healthcare systems, cloud-based data pipelines, and distributed microservices architectures. 
- Beyond full-stack development, I'm passionate about systems programming and database internals â€” from buffer pools and B+ trees to transaction protocols and query execution.
- I'm currently diving deeper into C++, operating systems, and database system design through projects like [BusTub](https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub) and custom storage engines.

Outside of coding, I enjoy **hiking**, **traveling**, and listening to **music**.
